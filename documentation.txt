- didn't include graphs because user may not have numpy or matplotlib installed
- decided to create data sets as json because that's how most APIs feed data
- dictionary rather than array for readability, no need to convert index to year, etc.
- factored out year range and data size for readability -  easier to readjust (data set and size) and (dictionary range)


TODOs
- edge cases => multiple years with same number of people
